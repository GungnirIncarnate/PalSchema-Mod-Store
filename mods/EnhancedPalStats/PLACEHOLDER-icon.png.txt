# Mod Icon Placeholder

In a real submission, this would be an actual PNG image file named `icon.png` (64x64 pixels recommended).

The icon should:
- Be 64x64 pixels for best display
- Represent the mod's functionality visually
- Be in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format
- Have a clear, recognizable design

For "Enhanced Pal Stats", the icon might show:
- A Pal silhouette with stat bars
- A chart or graph symbol
- Statistics/analytics themed imagery
